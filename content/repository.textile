h1. Git Repositories

Don't worry if it doesn't make sense right away! It's awesome if it does,
though!

h1. Objects

* Everything is an object.
* Objects never change after they are created. (immutable)
* An object has
## type: blob (file), tree (directory), commit (revision), tag
## size
## contents
* Objects are named by SHA-1 hashes of contents
** Full names are long and ugly: @435fcb11778c090e6b686d71361ecf30809694e6@
** Short names: @435fc@ (any prefix, as long as it's unique)
** No duplicates!

h1. Trees

h1. Commits

h1. Trees vs Commits

* Top-level tree - snapshot of all files and dirs in projects.
* Commit = version. Tree + metadata.
** Who produced the tree. (author)
** Author's explanation of what is changed in the new version. (message)
** Commits the author used to produce this commit. (parents)

h1. Tags

<div style="text-align: center;">
!{text-align:center;height:70%;}images/object-tag.png!
</div>

h1. Trees vs Commits vs Tags

* Top-level tree = snapshot of all files and dirs in projects.
* Commit = version. Tree + metadata.
** Who produced the tree. (author)
** Author's explanation of what the version means. (message)
* Tag = release. Commit + more metadata.
** Tag's author (e.g., project's release manager)
** Author's explanation of release. (message)

h1. Simplified View

* Commit = version.
* Commit parents = versions immediately before this version.
* Commits form a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

h1. Demo I: Repository Structure

# @git gui@
# select @Repository@ > @Visualize all branch history@

h1. Demo II: Commits as Documentation

History
* "Commits":https://github.com/pwnall/gitty/commits
* Big problem broken down in small steps.
* Almost as good as a live demo, if commits are small.

Commit
* "Commit: follow / unfollow in newsfeed.":https://github.com/pwnall/gitty/commit/3b1e2d68305353d8f7d22b62923b679387f385cb
* All the changes related to a feature.
* Shows how files are related to each other.
