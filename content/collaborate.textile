h1. Centralized Version Control

* Central server stores authoritative copy of repository
* Pro: linear history that everyone agrees on
* Pro: revision numbers are short, sequential numbers -> can be used for versioning
* Con: server down -> can't collaborate
* Examples: Subversion (SVN), CVS, Perforce

h1. Distributed Version Control

* Everyone has full copy of repository
* Examples: Git, Mercurial (hg), DARCS
* Pro: no single point of failure
* Pro: can work without Internet access
* Con: history isn't linear
* Con: revision numbers are long monstruosities
