h1. Development Workflow

Git has many ways to achieve a result. I teach the workflow that I use.

h1. "In the Zone" Workflow

# Create project dir
# Create repository
# Code a feature
# Commit the feature
# Go to step 3

h1. "In the Zone" Workflow

# Create project dir
** @mkdir project@
** @cd project@
# Create repository
** @git init@
# Code a feature
** _magic_
# Commit the feature
# Go to step 3

h1. "In the Zone" Workflow

# Create project dir
# Create repository
# Code a feature
# Commit the feature
** @git add .@
** @git status@
** @git add -u .@
** @git status@
** @git commit -m "Initial homepage."@
# Back to step 3.

h1. Git Has 3 Worlds

<div style="text-align: center;">
!{text-align:center;height:70%;}images/staging_index.png!
</div>

h1. Git Has 3 Worlds

# The repository
** All the versions of your project
# The working copy
** The version in the filesystem
** Other programs (e.g. your text editor) can only see this one
# The staging area (a.k.a. the _index_)
** A commit "under construction"
** Committing: staging area -> new commit
** Staging: working copy -> staging area

h1. Paranoid Committing

# Stage all changes except for deletion 
** @git add .@
# Show me what's about to happen
** @git status@
# Stage deletions
** @git add -u .@
# Make the commit
** @git commit -m "Initial homepage."@

h1. Faster Committing

# Stage *all* changes 
** @git add -A .@
# Show me what's about to happen
** @git status@
# Make the commit
** @git commit -m "Initial homepage."@

h1. Fastest Committing

# Stage *all* changes, make the commit.
** @git commit -a -m "Initial homepage."@

h1. "Out of the Zone" Workflow

What did I do recently?
* @git log@
* Shows recent commits

h1. "Out of the Zone" Workflow

Oh man, I shouldn't have committed that!
* @git reset HEAD^@
* Undoes your last @git commit@
* The commit contents is available in the working tree

Oh man, I shouldn't have committed that, or that, or that!
* @git reset HEAD^^^@ does 3 commits
* @git reset HEAD~3@ also does 3 commits

h1. "Out of the Zone" Workflow

I think I want this file in a different commit :(
* @git reset HEAD -- file@ unstages an update
* @git rm --cached file@ unstages a newly added file

h1. "Out of the Zone" Workflow

Those last two commits really are the same feature.
* @git rebase -i HEAD^^@
* Rebasing is the easiest way to screw up your repository
* Rebasing is also the most powerful tool for history rewriting
